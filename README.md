This is a simple and responsive To-Do List web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add tasks, mark them as complete or incomplete, delete individual tasks, and clear all tasks. The app also uses the browser's localStorage to save tasks, ensuring that your to-do list persists even after refreshing the page. Designed with a clean and responsive layout, it works seamlessly across different devices. To run the project locally, simply clone the repository, navigate to the project folder, and open the index.html file in your browser. This project is ideal for beginners looking to understand DOM manipulation and localStorage in JavaScript. Future updates may include features like due dates, task categories, drag-and-drop reordering, and user authentication for online task saving. The project is open-source and available under the MIT License.
